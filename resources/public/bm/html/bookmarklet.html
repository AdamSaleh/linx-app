  <!--

The bookmarklet adds query params to the iframe request. The server
constructs html with those values embedded. The constructed html
contains a script element. The script uses the embedded values to pop
up something interesting. Maybe the iframe is absolutely positioned?

If that doesn't work. Maybe the bookmarklet should contain a token
passed to the server to validate the user. Just like a cookie. How
secure is that? Well, it's on a user's browser. So, in the same way a
hacker can get into a browser and cut/paste the cookie, then can do
the same with the token. So it's no worse. The token could contain
something interesting, like the source IP, but then that doesn't
really fly in the mobile world. So, the cookie itself, I think, is
what it should be, and it should be folded in to the actual request.

This means, I think, that it's better to just construct the html via
hiccup, or use a template language, if I must (or make one up).
