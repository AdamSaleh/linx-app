# book-web

This is a practice application to help me explore some of the webapp
techniques I've been interested in for a while, the main one of which
is how to use a bookmarklet.

## What the App Does

Provides a simple bookmarking service. You join, sign-in, put a
bookmarklet on your browser's bookmark bar, surf, surf, surf, then hit
the bookmarklet when you want to bookmark a page. I imagine this is
exactly like countless other very similar services. The difference?
_I_ wrote this one and expect to learn quite a bit from it.

You can read all you want about how things are done, and then you can
do them. Two different things.

As it turns out, I think I have an actual use for this: I use a Mac at
work, and a Mac at home, and I've synched bookmarks and reading-list
links via iCloud. The links show up on my phone and iPad. Works great.

But I want to keep a clean separate between my work Mac and my home
Mac. If I find something of interest at work, where do I put that link
so I can get back to it at home? Could email it. Could use one of the
admirable third party services out there. Or I can write my own.

Which is what I'm going to do.

## Goals, To Do, Loose Ends

What I need to implement before I consider this application done.

  * ~~Basic bookmarklet~~

  * ~~Server side app, Clojure + Mongo~~

  * ~~Authentication via persistent, encrypted cookie~~

  * Cool, no-fuss way to join website (capcha begone!)

  * ~~Search bookmarks~~

  * ~~Add bookmark~~

  * Edit bookmark

  * Delete bookmark

  * Display bookmarks according to logged in user

  * Bookmark page should continuously update so you can see new
    bookmarks appear

  * Create a generic key/value collection in Mongo for storing
    encryption keys

  * Proper file based configuration

  * Proper handling of errors via bookmark

  * ~~Proper keyboard intercepts (return, esc) for bookmarklet~~

  * Store crypto key in mongo (thus the generic key/value store)

  * Rename the app as "linx"

  * Tidy up the server side code (but be sloppy until then).

I'll add more to the list as I figure out stuff I forgot, but "tidy up
the code" will always be last.

## Maintenance Issues

Stuff I don't have to finish to be done, but ought to finish over
time.

  * Check proper CSS interference when the bookmark form is displayed
    on other pages. (How to I properly reset everything so the style's
    my own and doesn't interfere with host pages?) I can keep working
    on this as I encounter more and more pages.

## Technologies

Using the following technologies:

  * Mongo DB

  * Clojure
    - compojure
    - monger
    - hiccup
    - assorted other convenience libs (json, logging, digest, crypto)

  * Javascript
    - jQuery

Nothing too fancy. I picked these because they can get me up and
prototyping about as quickly as possible, and because they use
microframeworks, which I favor because they allow the problem I need
to solve to dictate the shape the the solution, rather than the
reverse.
